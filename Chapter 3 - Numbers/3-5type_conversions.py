# To change python data types to an integer use the int() function.
# int(True)
# 1
# int(False)
# 0
# bool(1)
# True
# bool(0)
# False

# Again here True is representated with any integer not as 0
# False is 0

# Integers can be any size in python (https://oreil.ly/6ibo_)
# Python can handle googoly integers without issue
